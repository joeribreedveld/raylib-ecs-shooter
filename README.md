# ECS Shooter

In development.

## Todo

-   [] Set camera target to entity id
-   [] Fully clean ECS dynamic systems in game.c
-   [] has_facing_offset and has_round_position for optimal rendering system
-   [] Entity reusing and replacement after destruction
-   [] Cleanup code looks for big functions like drawing
-   [] Helper function for mouse world position (used in multiple places)
-   [] Test functionality with multiple player with different direction all shooting at mouse pos

### Later

-   [] Grass tiles background
-   [] Layer component and rendering per layer
-   [] Document non-obvious ECS patterns
